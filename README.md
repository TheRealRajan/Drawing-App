# Drawing-App
A **drawing app** using the Canvas API.<br><br>
You can draw/paint using a brush inside the canvas.<br><br>
You can choose the color of the brush as well as the canvas using the color selecting input boxes on the toolbar right below the canvas.<br><br>
You can also adjust the size of the brush by clicking on the " + " and " - " buttons.<br><br>
If you would like to start over, you can clear everything on the canvas by pressing the " X " button.<br><br>
The demo is live at *https://therealrajan.github.io/Drawing-App/*

Improvements are always welcome. If you have any, send me a pull request!
